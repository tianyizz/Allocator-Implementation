Program 1: 

Known Design: the program is to implement malloc, realloc, free, calloc using mmap and munmap. The program should do anything that the functions provided by system did.

Known Problem: The program will have problems when dealing with large amounts of calloc, realloc, malloc, and free. The definite cause is unknown. I thought the problem was caused by inefficient memory usage but, after my program passed the efficiency test, I cannot think of any reasons anymore.
